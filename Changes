        - Bug fixes: pattern options were ignored, -f option didn't work.
        - Changes: special variables $MOL, $PATT, $FILE, $MATCH are now 
        uppercase.
        - Features: new special variables @A and @B.
        - Documentation: fixed some errors, revised examples.
        - Tests: added a few simple tests, based on the examples in the POD.
