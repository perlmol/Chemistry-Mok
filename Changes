Revision history for Perl extension Chemistry::Mok.

0.25  May 16 2005
        - Read one molecule at a time using the Chemistry-Mol-0.30 interface.
        - New special variable $FH
        - Added support for Chemistry::3DBuilder (-3 command-line option)
        - Add #line to the generated code so that errors give more meaninful
          line numbers.
        - Fixed parsing bug where the first block used an explicit pattern
          language
        - Restructured Chemistry::Mok to be more object-oriented: 
        - WARNING: the mok object is now a hash reference instead of an array
          reference. This may affect derived classes.

        - Changes: special variables $MOL, $PATT, $FILE, $MATCH are now 
        uppercase.

        - Documentation: fixed some errors, revised examples.
        - Tests: added a few simple tests, based on the examples in the POD.
        See *.mok. The tests use the *.mol files that are provided. Note that
