Chemistry/Mok version 0.10
==========================

The purpose of mok is to read all the molecules found in the files that are
given in the command line, and for each molecule execute the CODE that is
given. The CODE is given in Perl and it has at its disposal all of the methods
of the PerlMol toolkit.

This mini-language is intended to provide a powerful environment for writing
"molecular one-liners" for extracting and munging chemical information.  It was
inspired by the AWK programming language by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger,
the SMARTS molecular pattern description language by Daylight, Inc., and the
Perl programming language by Larry Wall.

Mok takes its name from Ookla the mok, an unforgettable character from the
animated TV series "Thundarr the Barbarian", and from shortening "molecular
awk".  For more details about the mok mini-language, see LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
in the man page.
